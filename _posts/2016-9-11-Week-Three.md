What did I do In the Past week?
This past week was a very busy week for me. I spent many hours working on the Collate project. In the end I got it to pass the tests but was not able to have it run an the Sphere grader.  

Whats in my way?
Since I have already submitted the project nothing is currently in my way right now in regards to that. I still do need to learn how to use the class tools, however, as my Travis CI build was always failing during the project.

What I plan to do next Week?
I hope to start in the second project and complete all the assigned readings from the textbooks. I also want to find out why exactly my program wasn’t working in sphere by seeing an example program of someone’s who’s worked. 

This week was a very challenging week for me. I put in around 20 hours on Wednesday and Thursday in an attempt to fully finish the project. I spent lots of time adding optimizations to my program, writing tests, dealing with edge cases, and trying to make my program pass sphere. Unfortunately, I was not able to finish that last part. I hope to learn from this and ultimately become a better programer. Additionally, I’ve been keeping up with the XP text and learning a lot about Python from the class examples and writing Python code for the project. The Career Fair is next week so my tip of the week is to start working on your resume, git hub, and pitch to the recruiters so by the time the fair roles around you know exactly what to do.
