Plan to finish the final phase of the project

This week was very a busy week for me. In addition to working on the project I have had a lot of work from other classes and interviews. I was glad to have Friday off as our group used this as an opportunity to meet and sync up with everyone. I was also glad to see Parvida solutions come and speak on Friday as they gave some very useful advice that I am trying to apply to my career search. All in all, in terms of content in this class it has been a relatively light week as we only actually had class on monday. It is very important to get our project done, however, which doesn’t fully relate to the exact content we are studying in class right now. All in all I am very proud of the progress that our group has made so far. Meeting up has been hard with 6 people as we all have different schedules and responsibilities and sometimes people(myslef included) don’t always check their slack notifications. My tip of the week is too have a Facebook group for everyone in your project in addition to a slack group as it as another way to communicate that can very much help out facilitating meetings.
