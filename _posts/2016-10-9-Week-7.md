What did I do In the Past week?
I studied for the test this week by reviewing the previous material and practicing examples of the stuff in class

Whats in my way?
Just finished the test so no current blockers

What I plan to do next Week?
Start on project three and stay up to date and all the current readings 

This week was a very busy week for me. I had multiple interviews with many exciting companies and also multiple project and tests but Iâ€™m very happy its finally over and I was able to get through them. All in all, I think I did a pretty good job but I hope I did well on this test and impressed some of the companies that I talked too. The language of Python has really been growing on me throughout this class and I think I will start developing more seriously.  I think I may even start developing in it for interviews. My big tip for this week is to get cracking the coding interview and practicing a bunch of extensive examples for the rigors technical interviews. My other big tip this week is to network and apply to as many jobs as possible. The worst that can happen is for companies to say no and networking opens up doors that would never have been available otherwise. All in all, recruiting is very exciting and nerve wracking but in order to get through it you need to have a persistent and hard working mindset and you will eventually accomplish great things!
