What did I do In the Past week?
This past week was a much busier week for me.The first project got assigned so I spent about 5 hours on working on that. I have a “dumb” solution that still needs a good amount of work. I also spent time on understanding the tools we will use in this class more. 

Whats in my way?
Right now I’m trying to improve my solution to the project. I have implemented a very basic cache that uses the number as an index and stores the cycle lengths. I think I need to implement elements of the meta cache and other types of caches we discussed in class for my solution to pass the sphere grader

What I plan to do next Week?
By this time next week I hope to have successfully finished the project and be learning new things in this class. I also hope to be fully proficient in using all the tools. 

This week I really like how much time we spent discussing the project. I felt the class time professor Downing dedicated to it was very useful and helped me start off the project. I’m still trying to understand what exactly the different type of caches mean but once I do, I’m sure I will be able to properly finish the project. I have found python’s syntax very intuitive and have felt that I have rapidly been picking it up. I have, obviously, used a few online resources to help me learn this language. My tip of the week is to use http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ to learn the basics of any new programming language, I really recommend them because they use real examples and thoroughly explain all the nuances.
