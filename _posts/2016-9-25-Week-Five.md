What did I do In the Past week?
I finished up the Netflix project by fully writing all the tests and making sure I had all the other nesscary files for submission.

Whats in my way?
No current blockers because the Netflix project has finished and there isn’t any outstanding work other than the readings

What I plan to do next Week?
Stay on top of all my readings and have started studying for the first tests thats coming up in 2 weeks

This week was a very educational week for me. I was very intrigued by the Netflix project because of the amount I use Netflix and am very happy me and my partner were able to get it done. I’ve been keeping up with the XP text and learning a lot about Python from the class examples and writing Python code for the project. My skills in Python are increasing and with each example the professor Downing demonstrates I learn something new. I really like the language because of intuitive and simple it was.The Career Fair was  this week which ended up taking a good amount of my time but was also very exciting. I learned about a lot of cool opportunities related to computer science and have started the recruiting process. I think that the Python as well as the general practices and techniques learned in this class such as version control and continuous integration will help me in the hiring process. A great Tip of the week for recruiting is reading the book: Cracking the Coding Interview as it has many general strategies and practice questions to prepare for the rigorous interview process.
