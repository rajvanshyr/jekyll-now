This week was a very interesting week for me. I am very interested in object oriented design as it is the basis of all programming and we are learning some very interesting design patterns related to refactoring. Additionally, reviewing Sql has also been very captivating as it a very important query language used in many different areas. The other big aspect of this class is the group project which I am very pleased with. My group has done a magnificent job and I am very excited to present with them next to next week. My tip of the week is yet again, related to our seemingly never ending job searches, make sure to have a LinkedIn and keep it up to date with relevant information. This includes everything from classes taken, to specific description of your accomplishment in your previous jobs and finally having up to date contact info. It is important to constantly grow you network, both online and in real life as the more people you are connected with the more likely you are to get a job. All in all, if you used LinkedIn right, you should have recruiters contact you which would make for a greatly simplified job search.
