What did I do In the Past week?
worked on finishing the 2nd phase of the project

Whats in my way?
working through the various different requirements needed to be done to finish the project

What I plan to do next Week?
Plan to finish the final phase of the project

This week was very a busy week for me. In addition to working on the project I have had a lot of work from other classes and interviews. All in all, I am very pleased with my team. They are very good at problem solving as well as communication which in my opinion leads to the best software projects. I think that we will do well on the 2nd phase of the DB projects and will continue to work hard on it up until the final phase.My pick of the week is a really interesting video a stumbled upon this weekend, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU. This video is very interesting because it talks about how artificial intelligence will eventually lead to artificial brains replacing actual human brains because artificial brains are much faster, able to recall and more in memory, don't require a salary, and don't make human hours. It goes on to say that these brains are gonna replace every field including professionals like doctors and lawyers as well as creative files like arts and music. All in all, artificial intelligence is very scary but also very interesting and it inevitably will take over the world.
