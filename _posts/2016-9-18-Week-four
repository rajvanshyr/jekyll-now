What did I do In the Past week?
This past week was a very busy week for me. I spent many hours working on the Netflix project. We have now minimized the RMSE to below 1 and have started writing tests.  

Whats in my way?
We have gotten the big part of the project solved which was good but we still need ti figure out why the travis CI integration is feeling and potentially add more optimizations.

What I plan to do next Week?
I hope to have finished the second project and complete all the assigned readings from the textbooks. I also want to be able to have done well on all the class quizzes this week.

This week was a very challenging week for me. We put in around 10 hours on Wednesday and Thursday each in an attempt to fully finish the Netflix project. We spent lots of time optimizing the RMSE, writing tests, dealing with edge cases, and trying to make my program pass sphere. Unfortunately, we still haven’t figured out the Travis CI part. I hope to learn how to use this tool because it has very much confused me in projects 1 and 2. Additionally, I’ve been keeping up with the XP text and learning a lot about Python from the class examples and writing Python code for the project. The Career Fair is this week so my tip of the week is to start writing cover letters now so you can apply for jobs online soon after talking to recruiters and to start ironing those suits and button up shirts.
