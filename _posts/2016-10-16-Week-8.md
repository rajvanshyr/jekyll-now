This week was a very exciting week for me. It is my 21st birthday today and I have been having a great time celebrating the right way with good friends. Unfortunately, this means that I wasn’t able to meet with my group too much this weekend, I’m confident I’ll be free this week however so Hopefully I will be able to get up to speed and make valuable contributions to the project. We have a very exciting Idea and I am eager to make a positive impact for my group. This week was also very exciting for me because I’ve found out that I have moved on two the second round of interviews for two of my top companies.  I’m excited to see what the future holds in store and I’m sure what I learn in this class will help me achieve my goals. My tip of the week is to practice your coding skills on leetcode.com. This site is very useful because they literally have 100s of different interview prep questions. I have been using it for a year and it has helped me get through many rigorous interviews.
