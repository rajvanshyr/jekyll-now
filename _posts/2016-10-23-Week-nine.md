What did I do In the Past week?
We finished up the first phase of the group project assigned in class

Whats in my way?
Working on the next phase of the group project as there are many more complexities associated with this step.

What I plan to do next Week?
Plan to get an early start to phase 3 of the project and make sure we finish it on time 

This week was very busy for me. In addition to having numerous meeting with my group and being in charge for the technical documentation of the project, I was preparing for an interview with my dream company, Uber. Writing the documentation was very interesting as I was exploring who exactly the site would be useful to and what the various use cases are of my product. I enjoy thinking about the actual applications of software that I am building as it ends up giving me a greater sense of purpose. This also relates to my interview tomorrow as I want to be a product manager which directly relates to my role in the project tomorrow. I have spent a long time preparing for this interview and think it has been pretty effective for the most part.  I think the most important thing to keep in mind is too have a cheat sheet that has bullet point answers to all potential interview questions. This can drastically benefit you and help you collect your collect your thoughts for the actual interview. All in all, I really hope to do well tomorrow.
