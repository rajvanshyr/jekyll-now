What did I do In the Past week?
studied for and took the final test for this class

Whats in my way?
nothing

What I plan to do next Week?
Study for my other finals as this class is over

All in all, I had a very positive experience taking software engineering. I learned a lot of Python which is a very important language in the field of Software Engineering as well as some Javascript SQL and design patterns. I think all of these will help me be a better programmer. Studying for the final this past week really made me realize how much I learned in this amazing class. I am very excited to apply the concepts of this class to a side project I am planning on doing over break involving data scraping of NBA statistics and rendering interesting visualizations with them. My tip of the week is to take this class, you will learn so many things from one of the best professors in the entire CS department. The way that Downing teaches through examples is very interesting and helps you learn a lot. Additionally, most UTCS students know Java very well but there are few classes that go as much depth into Python as this one. It is very important to learn Python as it is being used nearly everywhere nowadays because of its intuitive syntax and wide range of possibilities. I want to conclude this blog post by thanks Prof Downing for an amazing class and urging whoever the reader of this may be to take this class!
