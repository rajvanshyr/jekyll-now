What I plan to do next Week?
plan to start studying for the second test which is fast approaching after Thanksgiving break.

This week was another great week of class for me. I learnt many new concepts and was, as usual very proud of my group for the stellar work they did on our project. Our site is a comprehensive database of open source projects that can potentially be very useful to both companies and developers alike. Open source projects are very important because they allow for a very unique design perspective. All in all, I think we did great work and am eager to present it to the class in the coming weeks. The other big thing thats left in this class is the test. I didnâ€™t do great on the first test but I know if I work hard and learn from my mistakes I can improve. My tip of the week is to practice every exercise we have done in class as many test questions last time were variations of these. Furthermore, these exercises help us understand the fundamentals of the class which is obviously crucial to doing well on the test. The best way to practice these is to have a study group and work on each exercise at the same time. After you are done compare your work and see what you did wrong. It can also be very useful to discuss different implementations for variations of the exercises.
